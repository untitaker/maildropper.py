# maildropper.py

maildropper.py is a replacement for
[maildrop](http://www.courier-mta.org/maildrop/), a local mail delivery agent.
While the original maildrop writes to mbox and maildirs, this one uses IMAP.
But the main reason i wrote this was so that i can get rid of the ridiculously
restrictive syntax of maildrop config files.
